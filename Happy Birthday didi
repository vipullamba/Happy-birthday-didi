    <h1>Happy Birthday, Didi! ðŸŽ‰</h1>
    <p>
      On this special day, I just want to take a moment to thank youâ€”not just for being an incredible sister,
      but for being the strong, caring, and beautiful soul you are.<br /><br />
      Youâ€™ve always been more than just my elder sister. Youâ€™ve been my second parent, my guiding light,
      and my biggest support system. Whenever life got tough, I knew I could count on you to stand by me,
      guide me, and lift me up.<br /><br />
      Your words give me strength. Your presence gives me peace. And your love gives me the courage
      to move forward even when things seem hard.<br /><br />
      Thank you for all the times youâ€™ve scolded me to keep me on the right path, and all the times
      youâ€™ve stood beside me when no one else did. I may not say it every day, but I truly look up to you
      and feel blessed to have you in my life.<br /><br />
      I pray that this year brings you everything your heart desiresâ€”success, peace, love, and lots of
      reasons to smile. You deserve all the happiness in the world, Didi, because you spread so much of it to others.
    </p>

      With all my love and respect,<br />
      Your little brother,<br />
